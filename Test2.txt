Stop distracting me
Take some time
Open your mouth
Wait over here
Close your eyes
Follow your instincts
Follow the rules
Nobody must know
Be careful now
Do something else
Finish the story
Make a list
Dance with me
Let me try
Nobody said that
No one cares
Proceed with caution
Wash your face
Give me half
Stay in there
Just stay still
Go for help
Take your seats
Grab my hand
Go warm up
Stop bothering me
Finish your drink
Things got violent
Things got strange
Keep it up
I am sad
This is good
Thanks a lot
She is old
Stop that now
Take a seat
Call for help
Go wait outside
Finish your work
Grab a spoon
She was deaed
Stop making excuses
Read it aloud
I am tired
See you around
I am happy
Count me in
Get to work
Stop hitting me
Keep it clean
