Allow me to demonstrate
Try it and see
Everything will be fine
Just try to relax
Everything looks pretty normal
Thanks for your reply
I am a man
She is a girl
I am very good
Stop thinking about it
Everybody seems very happy
Everything has a purpose
Put your hat on
Go wash your hands
Nothing can be done
Go wash your face
Here are some tips
Now I feel bad
Give us the details
Leave it with me
Go have some fun
No one understands that
Have a pleasant journey
Go clean yourself up
Give me the keys
Your ideas are welcome
Nobody is doing anything
Stay put for now
Most people think so
Write down each word
Put down the knife
Look at that picture
Thanks for hiring me
Keep the door closed
Just try to relax
I want to die
No one was killed
Go get your car
I want to go
Nobody is stopping you
It is very good
Carry this for me
Nobody likes that guy
Keep to the right
Stop wasting my time
Nothing will change that
Show me the plan
Thanks for the invitation
Just please be careful
Give me some credit
